                    Romit Maulik is an Assistant Professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). He is also a co-hire in the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences at Penn State and a Joint Appointment Faculty at Argonne National Laboratory. He obtained his PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University (in 2019) and was the Margaret Butler Postdoctoral Fellow (from 2019-2021) before becoming an Assistant Computational Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory (from 2021-2023). His group studies high-performance multifidelity scientific machine learning algorithm development with applications to various multiphysical nonlinear dynamical systems such as those that arise in fluid dynamics, geophysical modeling, nuclear fusion, and beyond. He is an Early Career Awardee of the Army Research Office.
